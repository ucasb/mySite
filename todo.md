# TODO ðŸš§

Hosting To Do:

- Reddit Post:
  - I've created a small (668 MB), static, personal portfolio site from scratch, basically just a bunch of hyperlinked .html pages and some photo/video/3D assets. I'd like to upload the website with a custom domain, so that its publically available. I'm assuming very low traffic, and updating the site 3  times a month max. My questions are:

  1) Is there a recommended (and affordable) hosting site that includes custom domains, and works by having you upload all your .html/css/js files and assets (instead of being stuck with an integrated web page builder)? 

  2) Can you recommend a source for a custom domain?

  2) Are there any security concerns with uploading a bunch of html and photo/video files, assuming none of my files and code contain any keys/valuable personal info? I'm using the little html/css/js programming knowledge I learned in high school, which never included anything about encryption or anything like that. Each page is very barebones. 

  I do have a rPi 4 Model B (2GB) just lying around, so I'm definetely open to a more DIY option if its more affordable, and if there's a dummy-proof tutorial. 

  Thanks in advance, all this stuff if very new to me.

About Me:
  - Photo of me

    I'm Lucas, born and currently living in Los Angeles. This website is primarily a portfolio of the things that I've designed and/or built that I'm proud of, some for work (found here), some for me (found here). I'm always looking for opportunities to delve deeper into the fields of industrial design, product design, and additive manufacturing. 

    I currently work as a Technical Designer and Draftsperson at a fabrication house that orbits LA's entertainment industry, and have past experience working in museums, makerspaces, and the additive manufacturing field. The job titles have varied place-to-place, but the common thread has always been building great things, and enabling others to do the same. While I'm a hands-on guy, I get enormous satisfaction in developing the tools and teaching the skillsets required to realize the build in your head, and I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to do so over and over again.

    [Include some examples?]

    When I'm not working, I'm cycling, poring over vintage mountain bike magazines, or visiting flea markets.

Skills/Experience in Brief:

      - Rhino 7
      - Common slicer software (Cura, Slic3r, etc.)
      - Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator
      - Arduino 
      - KiCAD 

    - Hardware:
      - FDM, SLA, and binder-jet 3D printing
      - CNC machining
      - Laser cutters (VLS, Epilog, those cheap Chinese ones)

    - Fabrication:
      - Casting / molding / mold design
      - Rapid prototyping
      - Carpentry 
      - PCB assembly 
      - Microcontroller-based mechatronics
      - Hardware hacking & circuit-bending  

Work History in Brief: 

      - Museum Work - Museum of Contemporary Art (2yrs) // The Getty Museum (3mo Summer Internetship)
        - I'm grouping th ese two here since they both happened such a long time ago, and don't have a ton of relevance to my current work experience. I will say I loved the museum field and that despite its faults, one of my absolute dream jobs (if I can ever afford it) is to work as a Museum Mountmaker for the Getty.

      - Oberlin Conversatory: Electronic Museum Studios Makerspace
        - Worked a few jobs here (Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, 'Makerspace Coordinator', etc.)
        
      - BitSpace Chicago
        - Initially, this job was teaching kids to make stuff using professional manufacturing tools - e.g. giving them (highly supervised) access to power tools, woodworking equipment, 3D printers, laser cutters, and also the necessary software and education. The idea (or at least my idea) behind the entire concept is giving students a glimpse of the myriad ways they can realize their ideas. 

        - This worked great until the first wave of lockdowns - as one of the few remaining staff members, I adapted existing, and designed entirely new curriculum for the new virtual normal. 

      - 3DEO - Prototyping Lab Manager
        - Managed and operated a prototyping lab that served a team of 30+ engineer working towards 3DEO's metal 3D printing technology. Daily responsibilities revolved around operating the hardware (3D printers, CNCs, laser cutter) and designing workflow-improving fixtures for various departments across the factory. I occasionally got to make some fun models for display (see here and here).  

      - 11th St Workshop
        - I currently serve as a Technical Designer & Draftsperson at 11th St Workshop, a Burbank-based fabrication studio serving CA and several surrounding states - you can see some of the highlights <here>. Our work is featured in music festivals, retail stores, fashion shoots, and Instagram backdrops. I flesh out client sketches into actionable, buildable drawings (using Solidworks 2023) that I pass off to our carpenters, metalworkers, and third-party vendors when necessary. 

    - Outside of work, I'm into my bikes, circuit-bending electronics, modular synthesizers, my cat, and some other stuff. 


incorporating multiple methods of manufacturing and design 

    When I worked at 3DEO operating their prototyping lab, I taught myself mold-making and casting using traditional methods and experimenting with incorporating 3D printing into the workflow. This later came in handy when I was tasked with mass-producing a complex part.... (the bellow)

    When I worked at BitSpace, I built myself a Jeopardy console using leftover summer camp microcontrollers and components, programming it using the code I learned... 


For 11th St Resume section

- Creates actionable build plans from client renders, prioritizing safety, feasability, cost, and quality. 
- Distributes design documents, models, and specs to fabricators, CA-liscenced engineers, and external vendors. 
- Tracks builds from conception to installation, considering factors that may affect objects construction, transportation, and on-site assembly.


Commercial, retail, event spaces, music festival things, conferences, studio sets, etc.
