        <h3>Hi:</h3>
        <p>I'm Lucas, born and currently living in Los Angeles. This website is primarily a portfolio of the things that I've designed and/or built that I'm proud of, some for work (found <a href="../work/work.html" target="_blank">here</a>), some for me (found <a href="../builds/builds.html" target="_blank">here</a>). I'm always looking for opportunities to delve deeper into the fields of industrial design, product design, and additive manufacturing.</p>

        <p>I currently work as a Technical Designer and Draftsperson at a fabrication house that orbits LA's entertainment industry, and have past experience working in museums, makerspaces, and industrial manufacturing. <b>The job titles have varied place-to-place, but the common thread has always been building great things, and enabling others to do the same</b>. While I'm a hands-on guy, I get enormous satisfaction in developing the tools and teaching the skillsets required to realize the build in your head, and I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to do so over and over again.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working, I'm cycling, poring over vintage mountain bike magazines, or visiting flea markets.</p>
